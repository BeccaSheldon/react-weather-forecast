#### What Does This Repo Do?
This is a little app that gets a weekly weathr forecast for a user-entered city. It uses Webpack 3, Babel, React, and the OpenWeather API.

#### Still To Do
- Optimize browser storage with cached searches
- More animations?
- Nicer UI?
- Add more React things? (Router?, Mobx?)
- Improve component code?

#### Run Locally
Just clone, run yarn, then `npm start` or `node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server` for hot reloading.

```
